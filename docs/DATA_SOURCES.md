## Methodology Notes

### Data Normalization

- Passenger numbers are presented in millions (M) or thousands (k) for readability
- Growth percentages calculated as: ((Current Year - Previous Year) / Previous Year) × 100
- Seasonal variations adjusted using quarterly data where available

### Limitations

1. **Estimation**: Some destination-specific numbers are estimates based on:
   - IRCTC tour package popularity
   - Airport passenger distribution
   - Hotel booking data correlation

2. **Overlap**: Passengers may use multiple modes (e.g., fly to a destination, then take bus tours)

3. **Fiscal Year Variations**: Different sources use calendar year vs. fiscal year reporting

### Quality Assurance

- Cross-referenced multiple sources for validation
- Consulted Ministry of Tourism annual reports
- Verified against previous year trends
- Excluded outliers and COVID-affected data
